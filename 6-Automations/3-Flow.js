ðŸŸ¥Flows in salesforce:
---------------------
- automation tool in salesforce that allows you to automate your business process easily using a visual design 
  interface without writing code.

-Example:
    - business need to send an email to the manager when a case is closed

Types of flows:
----------------
ðŸŸ¥ 1-Screen flow
    ------------
    - used to guide the user through a process or collect data from the user.
    - used to created multiple different records on the same page.
    - runs when the user interacts with the flow

        Trigger: manually triggered by the user
        Use case: guide the user through a process or collect data from the user
        Execution: runs when the user interacts with the flow  

ðŸŸ¥ 2- Record-triggered flow:
     -----------------------
     - used to execute logic when a record is created or updated or deleted
     - runs before or after the record is saved
     - runs in the background without user interaction
     - before-save(Fast field updates) : for quick field updates on the same record or validation rules
     - after-save(Actions On Related Record): for updates on related records or send an email
     - use case: send an email when a case is closed


        
â¬œ 3-Autolaunched flow(subflow)
------------------------------
- it is a subflow that can be called from other flows or processes
- used to create reusable logic that can be used in multiple flows
- takes input and returns output like a function in programming
- example: autolaunched flow to send an email.
           -can be used in multiple flows.


ðŸŸ¥ 4-Scheduled flow
-------------------
- used to run a logic at a specific time frequently(once, daily, weekly).
            
                Trigger: runs at a specific time
                Use case: send a birthday email to the contact or
                          send a notification to the opportunity owner before 2 days from the close date


ðŸŸ¥ platform event triggered flow
-------------------------------
- used to execute logic when a platform event is published in salesforce like
   1- Flow Execution Error Event
   2- Flow Interview Event
   3- Flow Pause Event
- use case: to save all the flow errors in a custom object to help the admin to track the errors


ðŸŸ¥ orchestration flow
---------------------
- used to coordinate multiple flows and processes to automate a complex business process
- it can be used to call multiple flows in a specific order
- it can be used to handle errors in a flow

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ðŸŸ¥ How do you trigger a flow in Salesforce?
-------------------------------------------
- Record-triggered flow: when a record is created or updated or deleted
- Screen flow: manually triggered by the user
- Autolaunched flow: manually triggered by the user or by a process
- Scheduled flow: runs at a specific time


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ðŸŸ¥ Flow elements: are the building blocks of a flow that perform specific actions or operations in the flow 
----------------
- Data (Create Records, Update Records, Get Records, Delete Records)
- Logic 
    * Decision (If/Else) used to check a condition and take different paths based on the result
    * Loop (For Loop, While Loop)
    * Assignment : used to assign a value to a variable 
                 : example: when we loop over the records and assign the record id to a variable
                 : we can use the record id in the next element in the flow to send an email to the record owner
- Integration (Apex, Callout)
- UI (Screen, Input, Output)
- Actions (Send Email, Post to Chatter, Submit for Approval)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ðŸŸ¥ Flow resources:
------------------
âœ…- Variables (Text, Number, Date, Boolean, SObject), used to store data that can be used in the flow
    - picklist choice set: used to display dynamically picklist values from an object field
    - text template: used to create a text template to include the record details in the email

âœ…- Constants (Text, Number, Date, Boolean, SObject)
âœ…- Formula: used to calculate the value based on the formula( Formula: {!$Flow.CurrentDateTime} + 2)
âœ…- SObject Collection (List of records)
âœ…- Apex Class (Custom logic)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
â¬œ How to handle errors in a flow?
---------------------------------
- Use a fault path to handle errors in a flow when an error occurs in an element 
- you can use the {!$Flow.FaultMessage} global variable to display the error message
- You can use the {!$Flow.CurrentDateTime} global variable to display the current date and time
Actions:
 1-Add a screen element to display the error message
 2- send an email to the user or the admin
 3- create a case record to track the error
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
â¬œ What are the connectors in a flow?
------------------------------------
- Connectors are used to connect elements in a flow to define the flow of execution.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
â¬œ What is the Global record variable and the Flow variable in a flow?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Record variable: used to store the record data in a record-triggered flow
- Flow variable: used to store data in a flow that can be used across the flow like current date and time
                 , error message.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
â¬œ how to pass the record id from the record page?
------------------------------------------------
-in the screen flow: you have to create a variable to store the record id 
                   : type- text
                   : API name- recordId
                   : Check the box "Available for input"
                   :in the lightning app builder: you have to check the box "Pass record ID into this variable"

- in the record-triggered flow: you can use the {!Record.Id} global variable to get the record id

Note: In Screen Flows, Salesforce doesnâ€™t automatically provide the record context. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
â¬œ what is the differnce between the ownerId and the userId in a flow?
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- ownerId: used to store the owner id of the record
- userId: used to store the user id of the current user
ownerId = userId if the record owned by individual user
ownerId != userId if the record owned by a queue or a public group
Note: to check the owner type of the record
      -you can check the Owner.Type field in the record 
      If Owner.Type = User â†’ The record is owned by a User.
      If Owner.Type = Queue â†’ The record is owned by a Queue.

-Queue: used to hold the records that don't have a specific owner
      : multiple users can be members of the queue
      : use case: to assign the case to the support team to handle the case


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
â¬œ how to send custom notifications in a flow?
---------------------------------------------
- used to send custom notifications to the users in salesforce
- first, you have to create a custom notification type in the setup to use it in the flow

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ðŸŸ¥Flow Best Practices:
----------------------
1- Use descriptive names for elements, variables, and resources
2- Use comments to explain complex logic or decision points
3- Use fault paths to handle errors and provide meaningful error messages
4- Use subflows to reuse logic across multiple flows
5- Use constants and formulas to simplify complex calculations
6- Test your flows in a sandbox environment before deploying to production
7- Document your flows and process for future reference
8- Use screen flows to guide users through a process or collect data from the user
9- Use record-triggered flows to automate business processes based on record changes
10- Use scheduled flows to run logic at a specific time or interval
11- Use autolaunched flows to create reusable logic that can be called from other flows or processes
